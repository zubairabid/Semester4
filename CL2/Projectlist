Some bullcrap on non Indian languages

1. Q/A system (prototype)
2. Dialogue System
3. Summarisation
4. Natural Language Generation
5. Coreference Chain
6. Anaphora resolution
7. Lexical Resource
8. Sentiment Analysis
9. Sarcasm detection



Things to consider
1. Q/A
	Non direct question
	Storage of data
	Understanding

2. Dialogue
	Reference?
	System directed? (single initiated)
	User directed? (like QA system)

Domains for both:
	Weather
	Sports
	Tourism/Hospital/Trains
	Short stories

Some general thing I've missed, she's discussing with the non CLD bengali

Shelly says she's going domain by domain

Also structured vs unstructured database

Questions outside domain should be discarded

3. Summarisation
	Non English (WHYYYYYYYY)
	Topics:
		Stories
	Multi or single documents

4. Natural Language Generation
	Headline generation
	Story generation

5. Coreference Chain
6. Anaphora resolution
	Probably rule based

7. Lexical Resource
	Wordnet - Sentilexicons
	Knowledge graphs
	Ontologies

8. Sentiment Analysis
	Classifiers
	Use:
		words
		features
		aspects
		document

9. Sarcasm detection

10. Any other
