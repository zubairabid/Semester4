# Bayesian Networks

**Basic Idea**: There is a table of probability distributions, and normally computing answers given events can be computationally intensive. So we use Bayes' Theorem and all the tools it gives us to turn the power of Inference into some magical thing.

## Math Fundamentals

..
$$
P(A,B|C) = P(A|C) \times P(B|C)
$$


...
$$
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
$$
